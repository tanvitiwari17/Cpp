/*
STL : Standard Template Library (powerful set of cpp template classes)
At the core of the cpp STL are following three well-structured components:
-Containers
-Algorithms
-Iterators

Containers:
    ~ used to manage collections of abjects of a certain kind.
    ~ provides containers that are used to create data structures like arrays,linked list,trees,etc.
    ~ these containers are generic, can hold elements of any data types

eg:-Vectors: used for creating dynamic arrays of char,int, float and other types

Algorithms:
    ~ act on containers.
    ~ provide means by which we perform initialization, sorting,searching, and transforming of contents of containers.
    ~ contains built in functions that perform complex algorithms on data structures.
    ~ provides abstraction

eg:- reverse(),sort(),binary_search()

Iterators:
    ~ used to step through the elements of collections of object.These collections may be
      containers or subsets of containers.
    ~ used to point to the containers.
    ~ acts as a bridge between containers and algorithms.

eg: sort() algorithm have two parameters, starting iterator and ending iterator.
